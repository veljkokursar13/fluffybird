# Skia Practices
- Extract draw logic into pure helpers returning paths/paints; keep JSX minimal.
- Document sprite coordinate system and anchor points.
- Avoid mixing Reanimated animations into Skia tree; bridge via shared values only when necessary.

# Pipe & Bird
- Pipe segments are vertically tileable; cap is separate; sizes come from settings.ts.
- Bird body is a base layer; wings are separate animated layer(s).
