# Boundaries
- Game physics & constants live under src/config/settings.ts and src/game/physics/*.
- Rendering is pure Skia components under src/game/sprites/*.
- Systems (spawning, scoring, collisions) in src/game/systems/* as pure functions.
- No magic numbers: import from settings.ts.

# Determinism
- Physics step must be deterministic for a given frame delta + seed.
- Introduce a lightweight RNG (seeded) for spawn variability; document its use.

# Performance
- Memoize Skia nodes. Avoid prop churn.
- Keep render components leaf-like; push math outside render paths.
