# Coverage Targets
- 100% for physics functions and systems.
- Smoke tests for Skia components (render without crash, key props).
- Golden tests for collision edges and score increments.

# Test Utilities
- Provide a test harness that steps the physics with a fixed dt and seed.
- Snapshots only for deterministic outputs (golden states), not for UI.
