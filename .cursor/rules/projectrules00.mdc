# Scope & Non-Overlap Contract
These rules define stack-specific implementation details for the Fluffy Bird app (React Native + Expo + Skia).
They rely on, but do not repeat, any global rules. If a conflict appears:
- Project rules override tool choices and file layout.
- Global rules still enforce process, security posture, reviews, and output format.

# TL;DR
- TypeScript-only, Expo Router navigation, Skia rendering, Reanimated for non-canvas UI.
- All dimensions/physics via src/config/settings.ts (single source of truth).
- Never change src/components/NavbarGrid/* markup; style via props/wrappers only.
